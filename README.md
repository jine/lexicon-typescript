# TypeScript Upskilling Course for Experienced JS Developers

This course is designed for developers with 10+ years of JavaScript experience (from a decade ago) plus PHP and jQuery background. It focuses on "good to know" essentials of modern JavaScript and TypeScript, bridging to your existing knowledge without rehashing basics.

The course complements the [Lexicon.se Frontend Developer Course](https://github.com/Lexicon-Utbildning-Front-end-2025-2026), emphasizing TypeScript during TS weeks: from basic syntax/datatypes to advanced functions, async programming, DOM manipulation, and integration with React/Next.js.
